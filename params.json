In my previous life, I was a C\\C++ developer but I converted to JavaScript in 2012. After using JavaScript for Unity 3D and hybrid app development for smartphones for a couple of years, I was introduced to Node.js and AngularJS both of which continue to fascinate and inspire me to this day. The breakneck speed of JavaScript development and its quirks have led to my continued enthusiasm for JavaScript which constitutes my day job as well as my hobby.\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\njunaidanwar10 [at] gmail.com",
